Call order automation system
A system to automate the processes of receiving and closing services on the street. For example, some air-conditioning cleaning or detection service.

It works in a simple way. Primarily there are two types of users, 1-administrators and 2-employees.
  1- Admin users are those who can create external service orders and pass them on to 2-employee users. Admin users also have access to 
  all values, days, hours, and number of orders in an overview of calls, organizing the data in tables and graphs;
  2- Employee Users are those who receive service calls from users 1-administrators to run on the servers. Employee users also have an 
  overview of their performance in terms of service orders, with these data being organized into specific tables and graphs for each 
  employee.
